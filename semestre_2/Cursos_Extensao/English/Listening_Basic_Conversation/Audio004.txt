basic conversation in english

- So, tell me about yourself! Oh my god, it sounds like a job interview...
How did you learn English? Well, okay, so... I started learning when I was a kid. Just like every kid in Brazil, you have those regular classes at school. Until I was seventeen, I had never really studied English before — just the regular school stuff. I was listening to songs and I wanted to sing them, but I couldn’t because I didn’t know the lyrics. I didn’t know how to pronounce the words. But I found out that my listening was okay.
So, I could hear and repeat what they said in the songs, but I didn’t really know what I was saying.

    THOSE == (AQUELAS)
    STUFF == (COISA)
    I FOUND OUT == (DESCOBRI)
    COULD == (CONSEGUIR/PODERIA - VERBO NO PASSADO)
    COULDN'T == (NÃO CONSEGUIA/ NÃO PODERIA - NEGAÇÃO NO PASSADO)

- Just to give you an example: I have a friend from Croatia. He came to Brazil and he taught me a song. I forgot how it goes, but I could repeat it, and he was like, “Oh man, you sound like a Croatian!” But until today, I have no idea what the song is about — I really don’t.
So, I kind of did the same with English. And then, when I was seventeen, I had the chance to go to an English school and study English, and I fell in love with it right away. I was like, “Wow, this is what I want to do for the rest of my life.” So I started studying every single day.

    TAUGHT == (ENSINOU-ME)
    UNTIL TODAY == (ATÉ HOJE)
    I KIND OF == (EU MEIO QUE)
    RIGHT AWAY == (AGORA MESMO)
    IT A RIGHT AWAY == (É IMEDIATAMENTE)

- My coordinator saw some potential in me and said, “Well, maybe you can become a tutor and help the students in the basic level, their first level, which now we now know as A1. You could be here teaching kids and teenagers, and I would help them with their homework and workbook in general. Then they gave me the opportunity to bring something extra to these kids.” And I said, “Okay, since you want something extra.” That’s when I started teaching English through hip-hop music. The kids loved it, and the teenagers were really excited about it. We had a great time.

    WICH NOW WE KNOW AS == (QUE AGORA SABEMOS/CONHECEMOS COMO)
    YOU COULD BE HERE == (VOCÊ PODERIA ESTAR AQUI ENSINANDO)
    TO BRING SOMETHING EXTRA == (TRAZER ALGO EXTRA)
    THROUGH == (ATRAVÉS)
    WE HAD A GREAT TIME == ("ESTÁVAMOS NUM BOM MOMENTO" "ESTÁVAMOS NUMA FASE BOA")
    EXCITED = EXCITADO/ANIMADO

- Believe it or not, I’ve been a teacher for twenty years now. I don’t understand everything, okay? So don’t even… yeah. Sometimes when I listen to rock and roll, most of the time I just don’t know what they’re saying. Then I’m like, “Is my listening bad? What’s wrong with me?”
No problem, I feel the same way.

    I'VE BEEN A TEACHER == (SOU PROFESSOR A)
    THEN I'M LIKE == (FICO PENSANDO, ENTÃO ESTOU TIPO...)
    I FELL THE SAME WAY == (SINTO O MESMO, EU SINTO A MESMA COISA)
