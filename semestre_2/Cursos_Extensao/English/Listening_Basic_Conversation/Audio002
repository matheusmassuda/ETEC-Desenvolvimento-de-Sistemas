- This was a little bit of our experience here in Dublin, in Ireland, and in different places around the country. I hope you enjoy this video, and I hope you practice your listening skills and also feel that everybody is in the same boat. Everybody’s trying, everybody’s communicating, no matter if you make a mistake or don’t know the right word or vocabulary. The most important thing is to try to communicate. So I hope you feel inspired by these amazing students. Subscribe, and I’ll see you in the next video.
