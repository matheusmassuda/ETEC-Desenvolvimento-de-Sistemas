- Okay, Clara, so tell us, where are you from? 

- That's kind of a hard question, because I was born in Brazil, but I grew up in Italy. I was born in the north of Brazil, but I have always lived in the south.

KIND OF A hard
(MEIO DIFÍCIL)

I HAVE always
(EU SEMPRE TENHO)

I ALWAYS TRY TO TRAIN MY LISTENING SKILLS
(EU SEMPRE TENTO TREINAR MINHAS HABILIDADES DE ESCUTA)

- Ok, so you speak Italian as your first language?
I have eight years when I started learning Italian. 
I tink you can say a technical term maybe is an early bilingual because you started at an early age.

- And how did you learn English? Mostly at home and at school. I really started learning it when I was around fifteen in a private school in Brazil. After that, I went on an exchange program to England for two months, where I stayed with a host family. That was an important experience for me to improve my English. At that time, I think my English was still at an intermediate level.

(PROGRAMA DE INTERCÂMBIO)
(NAQUELA ÉPOCA)

- I was studying for my bachelor's in International Relations, and then I needed English because I realized it would be important when I first started my studies. I feel that I truly learned it when I became confident enough to speak English at an academic level, or at the level I needed when I moved to Bosnia.

(WAS STUDYING - ESTAVA ESTUDANDO)

RELIZE - ENTENDER
I RELIZED - PERCEBER/ENTENDER
CONFIDENT - CONFIANTE
    I'M SO SO CONFIDENT NOW
    I'M CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO DO THAT
ENOUGH - SUFICIENTE

- Bosnia is a country—Bosnia and Herzegovina, that's the full name. I did my final paper for my bachelor's on the war in Bosnia, and after I graduated, I moved there for six months as an intern. There, English is the common language. That was a very important experience for me because I had to speak English every day.

APPARED AGAIN - A LITTLE BIT OF (UM POUCO)

- I know we don't have a secret, but whats is the secret to being fluent in a language, in your opinion?

(SEI QUE NÃO TEMOS/NÃO HÁ SEGREDO)

- Honestly, that's not a secret. I moved to Italy when I was a kid, and that's why I learned the language—because I went to school there. I was a child, so I learned faster, but I really learned because I was immersed in the language, right? Every day, you listen, interact, and learn new words. It was the same with English in the countries I visited, but sometimes, especially with English, I struggled to reach the level I wanted. I thought the only way to truly learn English was to move to an English-speaking country and seriously stop speaking Portuguese all the time!

THERE - LÁ
THE SAME - O MESMO
    THE SAME THING AS WALKING ON THE LAKE
