- Okay, Clara, so tell us, where are you from? 

- That's kind of a hard question, because I was born in Brazil, but I grew up in Italy. I was born in the north of Brazil, but I have always lived in the south.

KIND OF A hard
(MEIO DIFÍCIL)

I HAVE always
(EU SEMPRE TENHO)

I ALWAYS TRY TO TRAIN MY LISTENING SKILLS
(EU SEMPRE TENTO TREINAR MINHAS HABILIDADES DE ESCUTA)

- Ok, so you speak Italian as your first language?
I have eight years when I started learning Italian. 
I tink you can say a technical term maybe is an early bilingual because you started at an early age.

(DESDE CEDO)

- And how did you learn English? Mostly at home and at school. I really started learning it when I was around fifteen in a private school in Brazil. After that, I went on an exchange program to England for two months, where I stayed with a host family. That was an important experience for me to improve my English. At that time, I think my English was still at an intermediate level.

(PROGRAMA DE INTERCÂMBIO)
(NAQUELA ÉPOCA)

- I was studying for my bachelor's in International Relations, and then I needed English because I realized it would be important when I first started my studies. I feel that I truly learned it when I became confident enough to speak English at an academic level, or at the level I needed when I moved to Bosnia.

(WAS STUDYING - ESTAVA ESTUDANDO)

RELIZE - ENTENDER
I RELIZED - PERCEBER/ENTENDER
CONFIDENT - CONFIANTE
    I'M SO SO CONFIDENT NOW
    I'M CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO DO THAT
ENOUGH - SUFICIENTE

- Bosnia is a country—Bosnia and Herzegovina, that's the full name. I did my final paper for my bachelor's on the war in Bosnia, and after I graduated, I moved there for six months as an intern. There, English is the common language. That was a very important experience for me because I had to speak English every day.

APPARED AGAIN - A LITTLE BIT OF (UM POUCO)

- I know we don't have a secret, but whats is the secret to being fluent in a language, in your opinion?

(SEI QUE NÃO TEMOS/NÃO HÁ SEGREDO)

- Honestly, that's not a secret. I moved to Italy when I was a kid, and that's why I learned the language—because I went to school there. I was a child, so I learned faster, but I really learned because I was immersed in the language, right? Every day, you listen, interact, and learn new words. It was the same with English in the countries I visited, but sometimes, especially with English, I struggled to reach the level I wanted. I thought the only way to truly learn English was to move to an English-speaking country and seriously stop speaking Portuguese all the time!

THERE - LÁ
THE SAME - O MESMO
    THE SAME THING AS WALKING ON THE LAKE

- Which language is the most difficult for Brazilians to learn, in your opinion, English or Italian?
There are two possible answers here. If we look at the similarity of the languages, I’d say Italian is easier because it has the same roots as Portuguese. In terms of grammar, the structure is pretty much the same, with lots of tenses to learn. We also share many cognates, many similar words. For example, if you listen to Italian, you’ll be able to recognize many words.

YOU'LL BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE (VOCÊ SERÁ CAPAZ DE RECONHECER)

- Italian has fewer sounds than Portuguese. Really? Do you mean vowel sounds?
Both vowel and consonant sounds. I’d love to learn more about that!
In Portuguese, we have seven vowel sounds, and Italian has them too.
If you hear Roma, you can understand what I’m talking about. But in Italian, when you hear Roma, you won’t be able to make the same connection with the letter “R.”
The same thing happens in English. For example, when we say something like hat, they might think it’s hat, not rat.
People usually say Italian is very easy to learn because you pronounce words exactly as you read them.

YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO MAKE THE SAME (VOCÊ NÃO PODE FAZER A MESMA)

-  What about this gesture? Is it offensive or not? Because I’ve heard it can be offensive.
Oh, that’s a good one, because it’s not really offensive, but you shouldn’t use it for everything that looks Italian.
This gesture actually means something like “What are you talking about?” or when you don’t like what someone said and you’re a bit pissed off.
For example: “I didn’t order pizza!”


    THAT'S A GOOD ONE (ESSE É UMA BOA)
    BIT PISSED OF (MEIO IRRITADO)

- Some gestures are really common, like this one. That gesture looks like the meme "do not feed the animals". Do you remember that meme?  
It's important to recognize this gesture. Yeah, absolutely. I have a video on my Instagram where I asked my Italian friends to identify what the Brazilian gesture means.  
This one means "that is delicious", like when the food is really good you do this. Another gesture means "what are you talking about?". I have no idea what this one means. It’s supposed to mean "it’s over" or "there’s nothing left".

    RECOGNIZE == RECONHECER
    MEANS == SIGNIFICA

- And talking about how Italians perceive foreign accents they hear: how do they perceive your accent? Do you sound like a native speaker to them, or more like someone from a different part of the country? How do they treat you when they realize you’re not Italian?

    realize == percebem

- Italy is really touristic, so everything's whenever you go it's going to be busy so busy

    BUSY == OCUPADO

- Have you ever been to the very south of Brazil? They say we have a “Brazilian Italy,” and I’d love to know if that’s true.


Já esteve no extremo sul... adoraria saber se isso é verdade
