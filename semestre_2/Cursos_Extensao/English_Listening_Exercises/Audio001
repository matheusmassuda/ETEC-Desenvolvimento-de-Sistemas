- I am not alone today, i have two especial guests with me.
(convidados)

- Rodrigo, you probably know him alredy
(já conhece)

- Who are you, and what do you do in the English Brazil course?
- What do you like to do in your free time? (cotidiano)
- What do you do for fun (informal);

- Well, i've beeen in this course for quarel a while now,like over four years probably.
quarel a while (bastante termpo)

- Well, I'm responsible for our podcast "behind the language" and also Pronunciation master

- So, pretty mutch like every 15 days, I'm there with the students for live conversations
1) pretty much like every 15 days (mais ou menois a cada 15 dias);
2) about two weeks, I'm there with the students for liver comunications

- So, my first question is: do you think it is possible to learn a language through music?
*através

- Oh, sure. Absolutely, absolutely.
- You learn not only vocabulary, but things like rhythm, pronunciation, uh intonation and words in context.
(não só, não apenas)

- I agree 100 percent with what she said
(concordo)

- And I would say: rhythm is more important than the genre, I think. So I would recommend starting with slower songs, you know, not too noisy, like rock and roll.
(barulhento / ruído)

- Hold on a second
(espera um segundo)

- I don’t remember the first time I understood the lyrics of a song, but I remember the feeling when I listened to: “Why do birds suddenly appear every time”. That’s so clear. It sounds like Portuguese. Oh my God, I know English!

Have you ever felt this?
(Você já sentiu isso?)

- RHCP sounds like: I understand the words individually, but when you put them together… that’s another story.
(essa é outra história, isso é outra história/coisa)

- We get carried away
(A gente se deixa levar..)

- Jesus Christ, I can’t stop thinking about this song, and it’s usually just one verse.
